Pattern matching in C# is a powerful feature that allows you to check the shape or structure of data and act accordingly. Introduced in C# 7.0 and expanded in subsequent versions, it helps make code more readable and expressive by allowing you to write concise and clear conditions.

### Key Pattern Matching Constructs in C#

1. **Type Patterns**:
   Type patterns allow you to test if an object is of a certain type and, if it is, to cast it to that type in the same expression.
   ```csharp
   object obj = "Hello, World!";
   
   if (obj is string s)
   {
       Console.WriteLine(s); // "Hello, World!"
   }
   ```

2. **Constant Patterns**:
   Constant patterns allow you to compare an expression to a constant value.
   ```csharp
   int num = 42;

   if (num is 42)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("The number is 42.");
   }
   ```

3. **Relational Patterns (C# 9.0)**:
   Relational patterns enable you to compare an expression to a value using relational operators.
   ```csharp
   int num = 10;

   if (num is > 0 and < 100)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("The number is between 1 and 99.");
   }
   ```

4. **Logical Patterns (C# 9.0)**:
   Logical patterns combine other patterns using `and`, `or`, and `not`.
   ```csharp
   int num = 50;

   if (num is >= 1 and <= 100)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("The number is between 1 and 100.");
   }
   ```

5. **Positional Patterns (C# 8.0)**:
   Positional patterns are useful with deconstructing data types like tuples or user-defined types with a deconstruct method.
   ```csharp
   var point = (X: 1, Y: 2);

   if (point is (1, 2))
   {
       Console.WriteLine("The point is at (1, 2).");
   }
   ```

6. **Property Patterns (C# 8.0)**:
   Property patterns allow you to match on the properties of an object.
   ```csharp
   var person = new { Name = "John", Age = 30 };

   if (person is { Name: "John", Age: >= 18 })
   {
       Console.WriteLine("This is an adult named John.");
   }
   ```

7. **Switch Expressions (C# 8.0)**:
   Switch expressions enable more concise and readable conditional logic than traditional `switch` statements.
   ```csharp
   var day = DayOfWeek.Monday;

   var message = day switch
   {
       DayOfWeek.Monday => "Start of the week",
       DayOfWeek.Friday => "Almost weekend!",
       _ => "Another day"
   };

   Console.WriteLine(message); // Output: "Start of the week"
   ```

### Example Use Case

```csharp
public string GetShapeName(object shape)
{
    return shape switch
    {
        Circle c => $"Circle with radius {c.Radius}",
        Rectangle r => $"Rectangle with width {r.Width} and height {r.Height}",
        Triangle t => $"Triangle with base {t.Base} and height {t.Height}",
        _ => "Unknown shape"
    };
}
```

In this example, pattern matching is used within a `switch` expression to handle different shape types.

### Benefits of Pattern Matching

- **Code Readability**: The intent is clearer and the code is more concise.
- **Type Safety**: Eliminates the need for manual casting and type-checking, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- **Flexibility**: Allows you to perform complex data checks in a clean and declarative manner.

Pattern matching continues to evolve in C#, with each new version adding more expressive and powerful constructs.
