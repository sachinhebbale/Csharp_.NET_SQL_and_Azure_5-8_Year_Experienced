Yes, you can achieve a **Singleton** using a **static class or static members** in C#, but they are not identical concepts. Let's discuss how to implement a Singleton using static members and compare it to using a static class:

### **Singleton Implementation Using Static Members**
In a typical Singleton pattern, we use static members to hold the single instance and control access to it. The class itself is not static, but it uses static fields and methods to ensure that only one instance of the class is created.

Here's an example of implementing a Singleton using **static members**:

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    // Static variable to hold the single instance of the class
    private static Singleton _instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
    private Singleton() { }

    // Static method to provide global access to the instance
    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                _instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation:
- The instance is held in a `static` field, which ensures that only one instance is created.
- The `Instance` property is `static`, providing global access to the single instance.
- The constructor is private, ensuring that no other class can instantiate this class.

### **Thread-Safe Singleton (with Static)**
In a multi-threaded environment, two threads might simultaneously try to create the Singleton, leading to two instances. To avoid this, the Singleton can be made **thread-safe** using locking or by leveraging a static constructor.

**Lazy initialization using `lock`:**
```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                {
                    _instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }
}
```

### **Using Static Constructor (Thread-Safe Singleton)**
The .NET framework provides an elegant solution for thread-safe Singleton initialization using a **static constructor**. A static constructor is executed only once, before any static members are accessed.

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();

    // Private constructor
    private Singleton() { }

    // Static property to provide global access to the instance
    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get { return _instance; }
    }

    // Optional: static constructor for further initialization
    static Singleton() { }
}
```
In this implementation:
- The `static readonly` instance guarantees that the instance is created once and only once.
- The static constructor ensures that initialization happens when the class is first accessed, making it inherently thread-safe.

### **Why Not Use a Static Class Instead?**
A **static class** can mimic some of the behaviors of a Singleton (global access and single instance), but it cannot fully replace a Singleton for several reasons:

1. **No Object Instance**: A static class has no instances, so you cannot implement interfaces or inherit from other classes, which might be required for certain use cases.
   
2. **State Management**: Singleton allows managing internal state through the single instance. Static classes can't hold instance-specific stateâ€”they only provide global, shared state.

3. **Lazy Initialization**: Static classes are initialized the first time they are referenced. In contrast, a Singleton can be lazily instantiated, meaning it's created only when needed.

4. **Flexibility**: Singleton offers more flexibility, such as allowing you to refactor to a multi-instance design later if needed, while a static class is rigid.

### **Conclusion**:
- **Static Members** are often used to implement the Singleton pattern, as they allow you to control the single instance of the class.
- A **Static Class** is a good alternative when you need a globally available utility, but it lacks the flexibility of Singleton, such as lazy instantiation, state management, and inheritance.
  
While you can use static members to implement a Singleton, a static class cannot replace all use cases of a Singleton, especially when you need stateful or flexible object behavior.
