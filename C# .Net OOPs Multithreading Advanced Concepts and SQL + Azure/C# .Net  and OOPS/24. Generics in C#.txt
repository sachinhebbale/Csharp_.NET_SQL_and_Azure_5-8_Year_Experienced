Generics in programming allow you to write flexible, reusable, and type-safe code by enabling functions, classes, and data structures to operate with different data types without sacrificing type safety.

How Generics Work
Generics use type parameters (like <T>, where T represents a placeholder type) that can be substituted with concrete types when the code is used. This prevents unnecessary code duplication while ensuring type correctness at compile time.


// Generic method
public class Utils {
    public static void Print<T>(T item) {
        Console.WriteLine(item);
    }
}

// Usage
Utils.Print(123);   // Works with int
Utils.Print("Hello"); // Works with string


Advantages of Generics
Type Safety: Prevents runtime errors by enforcing type correctness at compile time.
Code Reusability: Eliminates redundancy and avoids writing multiple versions of the same logic for different data types.
Performance Optimization: Avoids unnecessary type casting and boxing/unboxing.
