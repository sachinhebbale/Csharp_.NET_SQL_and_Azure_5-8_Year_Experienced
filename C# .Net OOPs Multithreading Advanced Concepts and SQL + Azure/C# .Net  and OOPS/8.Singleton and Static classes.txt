**Singleton** and **Static classes** are both design patterns in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes and have key distinctions. Here's a breakdown of each:

### **Singleton Pattern**
- **Purpose**: The Singleton design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
  
#### Key Features:
1. **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class is created during the application's lifetime.
2. **Global Access**: Provides a global point of access to the instance, usually via a static method or property.
3. **Thread-Safe** (optional): In multi-threaded environments, Singleton can be designed to be thread-safe to prevent multiple instances from being created by different threads.

#### Example:
In C#:
```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;

    // Private constructor prevents instantiation from other classes
    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton GetInstance()
    {
        if (_instance == null)
        {
            _instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return _instance;
    }
}
```

### **Static Class**
- **Purpose**: A static class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated, and all its members must be static. It is used when you want to group utility functions or constants together that don't need to be tied to a particular object instance.

#### Key Features:
1. **No Instances**: You cannot create an instance of a static class.
2. **Only Static Members**: All members (fields, methods, properties) of a static class must be static.
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Since it cannot be instantiated, there is no memory overhead for objects. All members are loaded into memory when the class is first used.

#### Example:
In C#:
```csharp
public static class Utility
{
    public static void PrintMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}
```

### **Key Differences**:
1. **Instantiation**:
   - **Singleton**: Can have only one instance, and it manages the lifecycle of that instance.
   - **Static Class**: Cannot be instantiated at all.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - **Singleton**: Instance is created when needed and retained for the lifetime of the application.
   - **Static Class**: Members are loaded into memory the first time they are used and exist for the lifetime of the application.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - **Singleton**: Can implement interfaces and inherit from other classes.
   - **Static Class**: Cannot inherit from any class (except `Object` implicitly) and cannot implement interfaces.

4. **Thread-Safety**:
   - **Singleton**: Can be made thread-safe using techniques like locking.
   - **Static Class**: Since itâ€™s not instantiated, its thread safety depends on the static members.

5. **Use Case**:
   - **Singleton**: When you need only one instance of a class and global access to it (e.g., for logging, caching, or database connections).
   - **Static Class**: When you have a set of utility methods or constants that do not require object state (e.g., math functions, string utilities).
