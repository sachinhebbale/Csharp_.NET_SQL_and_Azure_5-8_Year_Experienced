In SQL, **global tables** and **temporary tables** are used to store intermediate results, but they serve different purposes, have different lifetimes, and are handled differently in terms of visibility and scope.

### 1. **Temporary Tables**

Temporary tables are created for short-term data storage, often used in a single session or transaction. There are two types of temporary tables:

- **Local Temporary Tables** (`#table_name`)
- **Global Temporary Tables** (`##table_name`)

#### a. **Local Temporary Tables (`#table_name`)**

A **local temporary table** is a temporary table that is only available in the current session or connection. It is automatically dropped when the session is closed or the connection is terminated.

##### Characteristics:
- **Scope**: Visible only to the session or connection that created it.
- **Lifetime**: Automatically deleted when the session ends or the connection is closed.
- **Name**: Starts with a single hash symbol (`#`).
- **Usage**: Used for storing temporary data during a session for complex calculations, data transformations, or breaking down large queries.

##### Syntax for Creating Local Temporary Table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE #TempTable (
    ID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);

-- Insert data into the temporary table
INSERT INTO #TempTable (ID, Name, Age)
VALUES (1, 'John', 25), (2, 'Jane', 30);

-- Query the temporary table
SELECT * FROM #TempTable;

-- The table is automatically dropped at the end of the session.
```

#### b. **Global Temporary Tables (`##table_name`)**

A **global temporary table** is a temporary table that is visible to all sessions and connections, but it is dropped automatically when the last session referencing it is closed.

##### Characteristics:
- **Scope**: Visible to all sessions and users.
- **Lifetime**: Automatically deleted when all sessions that reference the table are closed.
- **Name**: Starts with a double hash symbol (`##`).
- **Usage**: Used when you need temporary data to be shared across multiple sessions or users.

##### Syntax for Creating Global Temporary Table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTempTable (
    ID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);

-- Insert data into the global temporary table
INSERT INTO ##GlobalTempTable (ID, Name, Age)
VALUES (1, 'John', 25), (2, 'Jane', 30);

-- Query the global temporary table in another session
SELECT * FROM ##GlobalTempTable;

-- The table is dropped when the last session that references it is closed.
```

#### Key Differences Between Local and Global Temporary Tables:

| Feature                | Local Temporary Table (`#`)            | Global Temporary Table (`##`)          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Visibility**          | Only in the session that created it    | Visible to all sessions                |
| **Lifetime**            | Dropped when the session ends          | Dropped when the last session ends     |
| **Name Conflict**       | Can have the same name in different sessions | Name must be unique across all sessions |
| **Usage**               | Session-specific, isolated queries     | Shared temporary data across sessions  |

### 2. **Global Tables**

Global tables are typically **permanent tables** that are accessible to all users, but in some cloud platforms like **Amazon DynamoDB**, **global tables** refer to special types of tables that provide cross-region replication and availability.

#### Characteristics of Global Tables (in the context of DynamoDB):
- **Replication**: Data is automatically replicated across multiple regions, providing high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Consistency**: Provides eventual or strongly consistent reads.
- **Usage**: Ensures high availability of the data across different geographic locations.

In SQL databases, **global tables** (as a general term) refer to tables that are **not session-bound**, meaning they are permanent and accessible to all users who have the necessary permissions.

##### Example of a Global (Permanent) Table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    Country VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Query this table across multiple sessions or connections
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

Unlike temporary tables, **global tables** (permanent tables) persist in the database until explicitly dropped using the `DROP TABLE` statement.

### 3. **Comparison of Temporary and Global Tables**

| Feature                | Temporary Table (`# or ##`)             | Global (Permanent) Table                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Visibility**          | Session-specific or all sessions (##)  | Visible to all users with permissions  |
| **Lifetime**            | Automatically dropped after session ends | Persistent until manually dropped     |
| **Naming**              | Can use `#` or `##` prefixes           | No special prefix                     |
| **Data Persistence**    | Temporary, session-specific            | Permanent, persists across sessions   |
| **Use Cases**           | Intermediate data storage, complex queries | Persistent data, application-wide storage |

### 4. **Use Cases for Temporary and Global Tables**

#### a. **Temporary Tables (Local and Global)**
- **Complex Queries**: Break down complex queries or store intermediate results.
- **ETL Processes**: Store temporary data during data transformation or data loading tasks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Used to optimize large queries by temporarily storing results in stages.
- **Testing**: Great for running temporary calculations or tests without impacting the permanent data structure.

#### b. **Global (Permanent) Tables**
- **Application Data**: Store long-term application data (e.g., customer, order, product details).
- **Shared Data**: Store data that needs to be accessed by multiple sessions or applications.
- **Historical Data**: Store historical data that must persist for reporting and analysis.
  
### Summary

- **Local Temporary Tables (`#TempTable`)** are session-specific, only visible within the current connection, and are automatically dropped when the session ends.
- **Global Temporary Tables (`##TempTable`)** are visible to all sessions and are dropped when the last session referencing them ends.
- **Global (Permanent) Tables** are permanent tables that are accessible to all users with appropriate permissions and persist until manually dropped.
  
These options give flexibility in handling both short-term and long-term data storage depending on the needs of your SQL operations.
