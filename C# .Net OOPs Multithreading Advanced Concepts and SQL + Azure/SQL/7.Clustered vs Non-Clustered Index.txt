In SQL Server (and other relational databases), **indexes** are used to speed up the retrieval of rows from tables by providing a fast way to look up data. There are two primary types of indexes: **clustered** and **non-clustered** indexes. Let’s break down each and their differences.

### 1. **Clustered Index**

A **clustered index** determines the **physical order** of data in the table. In a clustered index, the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index. Each table can have only one clustered index because there can only be one physical order for the data.

#### Key Points about Clustered Index:
- **Physical Ordering**: Data is physically sorted and stored according to the clustered index.
- **One per Table**: A table can have only one clustered index.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Great for queries that retrieve ranges of data because it reads contiguous data blocks on the disk.
- **Primary Key**: By default, if a primary key is defined, SQL Server automatically creates a clustered index on it.

#### Example of Creating a Clustered Index:

```sql
-- Create a clustered index on the "OrderID" column
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Orders_OrderID
ON Orders(OrderID);
```

This command creates a clustered index on the `OrderID` column of the `Orders` table. The table will now be physically ordered by `OrderID`, which can improve performance when querying by this column.

#### Clustered Index Structure:
- The data is stored in a **B-tree** structure where the leaf nodes contain the actual data rows.
- As the data is physically sorted by the indexed column, retrieving ranges of data (e.g., `WHERE OrderID BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000`) becomes faster.

### 2. **Non-Clustered Index**

A **non-clustered index** does **not** alter the physical order of the data in the table. Instead, it creates a separate structure that stores pointers (row locators) to the actual data rows. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

#### Key Points about Non-Clustered Index:
- **Logical Ordering**: It provides a logical ordering of data but does not affect the physical order of the table.
- **Multiple per Table**: A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.
- **Faster Lookup for Specific Columns**: It improves performance for queries that search based on the indexed column but don't need to retrieve large ranges of data.
- **Uses Pointers**: Non-clustered indexes store the indexed column's value along with a pointer to the corresponding data in the clustered index or the heap.

#### Example of Creating a Non-Clustered Index:

```sql
-- Create a non-clustered index on the "CustomerID" column
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Orders_CustomerID
ON Orders(CustomerID);
```

This command creates a non-clustered index on the `CustomerID` column of the `Orders` table. When you query by `CustomerID`, SQL Server will use the index to find the relevant row more efficiently without scanning the entire table.

#### Non-Clustered Index Structure:
- The data is stored in a separate **B-tree** structure.
- The leaf nodes of the non-clustered index contain pointers to the actual data rows (either in the clustered index or directly in the heap, if no clustered index exists).

### 3. **Comparison: Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Index**

| Feature                  | **Clustered Index**                               | **Non-Clustered Index**                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical Data Storage** | Sorts and stores the actual data rows in order    | Stores a separate structure (pointer to data)   |
| **Data Sorting**          | Physically arranges data based on the index       | Does not sort the actual data, only the index   |
| **Number of Indexes**     | Only one per table                                | Multiple per table                              |
| **Storage Location**      | Leaf nodes contain actual data                    | Leaf nodes contain pointers to the data rows    |
| **Speed**                 | Fast for range queries and retrieving ordered data| Fast for exact lookups but slower for ranges    |
| **Usage**                 | Used for primary keys or frequently queried ranges| Used for columns frequently searched, but not part of the primary key|

### 4. **Examples of Usage**

#### Clustered Index Example:
Consider a table called `Employees` with a clustered index on the `EmployeeID` column.

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employees_EmployeeID
ON Employees(EmployeeID);
```

In this case, the rows in the `Employees` table will be stored in ascending order based on the `EmployeeID` value. If you run a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 12345;
```

The database engine can go directly to the location of `EmployeeID = 12345` without scanning the entire table.

#### Non-Clustered Index Example:
Suppose you often run queries on the `LastName` column. You can create a non-clustered index on that column:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employees_LastName
ON Employees(LastName);
```

Now, when you run queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
```

The database can quickly search the index for `LastName = 'Smith'`, then use the pointer in the index to locate the actual row in the table.

### 5. **Choosing Between Clustered and Non-Clustered Index**

- **Clustered Index**: Use for primary keys or columns that are frequently used in `ORDER BY` clauses or range queries (e.g., retrieving a range of dates, IDs).
  
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Use for columns that are often searched but are not the primary key. This helps in fast lookups and filters. Non-clustered indexes are especially useful for columns that are often used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, or for frequently queried columns.

### 6. **Index Best Practices**

- **Primary Key**: By default, SQL Server creates a clustered index on the primary key column. Ensure that the primary key is a good candidate for clustering (e.g., unique, increasing).
- **Avoid Too Many Indexes**: Although indexes speed up read operations, they slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index needs to be updated every time the underlying data changes.
- **Covering Indexes**: A non-clustered index can be designed to **cover** a query by including all the columns the query needs in the index. This prevents having to retrieve the actual table row, further speeding up the query.

#### Example of a Covering Index:
```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Orders_CustomerID_Include
ON Orders(CustomerID)
INCLUDE (OrderDate, TotalAmount);
```

This index helps in queries like:
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = 101;
```
All the columns (`CustomerID`, `OrderDate`, `TotalAmount`) are included in the index, so the database doesn't have to retrieve the actual row from the table.

### Summary:

- **Clustered Index**: Defines the physical order of rows in a table. You can have only one clustered index per table because there can be only one physical order. It’s most beneficial for columns with range queries or sorted retrieval.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Provides a logical ordering of rows without altering the table’s physical structure. Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist on a table, and they are great for fast lookups or filter-based queries.
