**Azure Table Storage** is a **NoSQL** database service.

### Key Features of Azure Table Storage:
- **NoSQL Model**: Azure Table Storage stores large amounts of structured, non-relational data. The data is stored as key-value pairs in a table format, but unlike SQL databases, it doesn't use relations between tables.
- **Schema-less**: There is no need to define a schema before using the table. Each row (or entity) can have a different structure, allowing for flexibility.
- **Partitioning**: Data is automatically partitioned to scale out horizontally across multiple servers, which enables high availability and quick access.
- **Query**: You can query data using the PartitionKey and RowKey, but it doesn't support complex querying, joins, or ACID transactions like a traditional SQL database.
- **Scalability**: Designed for scalability and high availability, making it suitable for applications that need to store massive amounts of unstructured data.

Azure Table Storage is often used for scenarios like logging, storing user data, and other high-scale NoSQL workloads.
