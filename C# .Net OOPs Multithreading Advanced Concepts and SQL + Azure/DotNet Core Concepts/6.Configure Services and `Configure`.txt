In ASP.NET Core, `Configure` and `ConfigureServices` are two key methods in the **Startup.cs** file that play a central role in the application's initialization and configuration process. Hereâ€™s what each method does:

### 1. `ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)`
- This method is where you **register services** with the Dependency Injection (DI) container.
- You add services that your application will use during its runtime, such as database contexts, logging, authentication, and custom services.
- The services are typically configured with **lifetime options** (such as `Transient`, `Scoped`, or `Singleton`).
  
Example:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Add services to the container
    services.AddControllersWithViews(); // Adding MVC services
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"))); // Adding a database context
    services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>(); // Adding a custom service
}
```
The `ConfigureServices` method sets up the services that will later be used in the request pipeline.

### 2. `Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)`
- This method defines how the application will **handle HTTP requests**. It sets up the **middleware pipeline**.
- Middleware are components that process HTTP requests and responses in sequence, such as routing, authentication, authorization, error handling, and static file serving.
  
Example:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); // Shows detailed exception information in development
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error"); // Generic error page in production
        app.UseHsts(); // Enforces HTTPS
    }
    
    app.UseHttpsRedirection(); // Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS
    app.UseStaticFiles(); // Serves static files from wwwroot folder
    app.UseRouting(); // Adds routing to the request pipeline
    app.UseAuthentication(); // Adds authentication middleware
    app.UseAuthorization(); // Adds authorization middleware

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

- The `Configure` method sets up middleware to handle HTTP requests, like routing, exception handling, and static files.

In summary:
- **`ConfigureServices`**: Used for registering services into the DI container.
- **`Configure`**: Defines the middleware pipeline that handles incoming requests and responses.
