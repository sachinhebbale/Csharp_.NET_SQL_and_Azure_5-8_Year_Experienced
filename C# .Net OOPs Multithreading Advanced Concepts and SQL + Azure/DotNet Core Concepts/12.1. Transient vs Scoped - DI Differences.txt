In **ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection (DI)**, **Transient** and **Scoped** are two of the **lifetime options** for registered services. They determine how instances of a service are created and managed.  

---

### **1. Transient Lifetime**
- **A new instance is created every time** the service is requested.
- **Best for stateless services** (e.g., lightweight, short-lived objects).
- Can lead to **performance overhead** if used excessively.
  
âœ… **Example:**
```csharp
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
```
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:**  
- Logging, Utility classes, Lightweight operations.

ðŸ’¡ **Example Usage:**
```csharp
public class HomeController
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService1;
    private readonly IMyService _myService2;

    public HomeController(IMyService myService1, IMyService myService2)
    {
        _myService1 = myService1;
        _myService2 = myService2;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        bool areSame = _myService1 == _myService2; // Always false (different instances)
        return View();
    }
}
```
ðŸš€ **Each injection gets a new instance**.

---

### **2. Scoped Lifetime**
- **A single instance per request (HTTP request in web apps).**
- Within the same request, the same instance is used.
- Ideal for **database contexts** where multiple services need the same instance.

âœ… **Example:**
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
```
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:**  
- Entity Framework Core `DbContext`, Business logic layer services.

ðŸ’¡ **Example Usage:**
```csharp
public class HomeController
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService1;
    private readonly IMyService _myService2;

    public HomeController(IMyService myService1, IMyService myService2)
    {
        _myService1 = myService1;
        _myService2 = myService2;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        bool areSame = _myService1 == _myService2; // True (same instance within request)
        return View();
    }
}
```
ðŸš€ **Same instance is shared within the request** but a **new one is created for each request**.

### **Summary Table**
| Lifetime   | Instance Creation | Scope |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Transient** | New instance every time | Always different instances |
| **Scoped** | One instance per request | Shared within the request |

**When to Use What?**
- **Use `Transient`** when you donâ€™t need to maintain state between requests (stateless services).
- **Use `Scoped`** when you need to maintain state **within a request**, like working with a database.

Would you like an example with `Singleton` as well? ðŸ˜Š
