In ASP.NET Core, **Tag Helpers** are a powerful feature that makes it easier to work with HTML in Razor views. They allow server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in a view.

### Key Features of Tag Helpers:
- **HTML-like syntax**: Unlike traditional HTML helpers (which are method calls), tag helpers look and feel like standard HTML elements.
- **Attributes-based**: They are activated by special attributes you apply to standard HTML elements.
- **IntelliSense support**: Tag Helpers are strongly typed, providing compile-time checking and IntelliSense support in Visual Studio.

### Common Built-in Tag Helpers:
1. **FormTagHelper**: Simplifies form elements like `<form>`. It adds features like automatic anti-forgery token generation.
2. **InputTagHelper**: Used with `<input>` elements. It helps bind the model data to input fields.
3. **LabelTagHelper**: Works with `<label>` elements, allowing easy binding with model properties.
4. **AnchorTagHelper**: Simplifies working with anchor (`<a>`) tags by making routing much easier.
5. **SelectTagHelper**: Works with `<select>` elements, simplifying model binding with dropdown lists.

### Example of a Tag Helper:

```csharp
@model UserModel

<form asp-action="SubmitForm">
    <label asp-for="Username"></label>
    <input asp-for="Username" class="form-control" />

    <label asp-for="Email"></label>
    <input asp-for="Email" class="form-control" />

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In this example:
- `asp-for` is a Tag Helper that binds the input fields to the properties of the `UserModel` class.
- `asp-action="SubmitForm"` is used to specify the action method where the form should be submitted.

### Custom Tag Helpers:
You can also create custom Tag Helpers by creating a class that inherits from `TagHelper`.

Here's an example of a custom Tag Helper that adds a "bold" tag around text:

```csharp
public class BoldTagHelper : TagHelper
{
    public override void Process(TagHelperContext context, TagHelperOutput output)
    {
        output.TagName = "strong";
        output.TagMode = TagMode.StartTagAndEndTag;
    }
}
```

Then, you can use it in your Razor view like this:

```html
<bold>This text will be bold.</bold>
```

### Advantages of Tag Helpers:
- **Separation of concerns**: Keeps your view logic and HTML separate.
- **Cleaner HTML**: Makes the Razor syntax easier to read and write.
- **Strongly typed**: Provides compile-time checking, reducing the chances of runtime errors.
