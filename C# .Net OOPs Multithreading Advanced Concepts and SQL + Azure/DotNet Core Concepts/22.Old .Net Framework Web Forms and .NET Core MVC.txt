ASP.NET Core Web Forms and ASP.NET Core MVC are two distinct frameworks for building web applications, but ASP.NET Core Web Forms doesn't exist as a direct equivalent in ASP.NET Core. To clarify:

- **ASP.NET Web Forms** was part of the **ASP.NET Framework** (not Core), introduced in the early 2000s. It allowed developers to build web applications using a drag-and-drop, event-driven programming model, similar to Windows Forms applications.
  
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** is part of the **modern ASP.NET Core** framework, which uses the Model-View-Controller pattern and focuses on a more lightweight, testable, and modular architecture.

Here's a comparison of **ASP.NET Web Forms** (from the original ASP.NET Framework) vs. **ASP.NET Core MVC**:

### 1. **Development Paradigm**
   - **Web Forms**: Follows an event-driven, stateful model. Developers work with server controls, drag-and-drop features, and an abstraction layer that hides much of the complexity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - **MVC**: Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It encourages separation of concerns by dividing application logic into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (application logic).

### 2. **State Management**
   - **Web Forms**: Uses a stateful model with a feature called **ViewState**, which helps to maintain the state of server controls across postbacks. This can result in large payloads sent to the client.
   - **MVC**: Is stateless, following the traditional HTTP request-response model. Any state management (e.g., session, cookies) is handled explicitly by the developer.

### 3. **Control and Flexibility**
   - **Web Forms**: Offers less control over the HTML generated due to the abstraction provided by server controls. It's designed to simplify things for developers but at the cost of flexibility and performance.
   - **MVC**: Provides full control over the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The developer writes the HTML directly and has complete control over how content is rendered, making it easier to create responsive, mobile-friendly sites.

### 4. **Separation of Concerns**
   - **Web Forms**: Has less strict separation of concerns. Code-behind files can mix business logic with UI logic, making it harder to maintain large applications.
   - **MVC**: Emphasizes the separation of concerns. The Model handles business logic, the View handles UI, and the Controller mediates between them, making applications more modular and testable.

### 5. **Testability**
   - **Web Forms**: Testing Web Forms applications is generally more difficult due to the tight coupling between the UI and application logic (e.g., code-behind files).
   - **MVC**: Designed with testability in mind. The separation of concerns allows developers to unit test business logic and application behavior separately from the UI.

### 6. **Routing**
   - **Web Forms**: Uses a page-centric approach, where each URL corresponds to a specific page (e.g., `about.aspx`, `contact.aspx`).
   - **MVC**: Uses a more flexible, route-based approach where routes can be mapped to controller actions (e.g., `/Products/Details/5`).

### 7. **Performance**
   - **Web Forms**: Due to the stateful nature of Web Forms (using ViewState), performance can degrade, especially for larger forms or controls.
   - **MVC**: Being stateless and lightweight, MVC generally offers better performance, especially for applications with high traffic and complex UI requirements.

### 8. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Control**
   - **Web Forms**: Abstracts much of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with server controls like `<asp:Button>`, `<asp:GridView>`, etc. This can make it harder to use modern front-end techniques.
   - **MVC**: Offers full control over the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You write standard HTML tags and have full flexibility to integrate modern front-end frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js.

### 9. **Partial Updates**
   - **Web Forms**: Supports partial page updates using **AJAX** controls like the **UpdatePanel**, but this can lead to performance issues due to ViewState.
   - **MVC**: Easily supports partial page updates using **AJAX**, and developers have full control over how data is handled and returned (e.g., JSON).

### 10. **Modern Development Practices**
   - **Web Forms**: Is more outdated and doesn't align well with modern web development practices, like REST APIs, single-page applications (SPAs), and front-end frameworks.
   - **MVC**: Aligns well with modern development practices and is designed to work seamlessly with SPAs, RESTful services, and client-side frameworks.

### 11. **Lifecycle Management**
   - **Web Forms**: Has a complex page lifecycle (e.g., Init, Load, PreRender) that developers need to understand and work with.
   - **MVC**: Has a much simpler request lifecycle. Each request is handled by a controller, which processes input, interacts with the model, and returns a view.

### 12. **Framework Future**
   - **Web Forms**: Was not ported to **ASP.NET Core**. It remains part of the **.NET Framework** and has reached the end of active development (no new features are being added).
   - **MVC**: Is part of **ASP.NET Core** and is actively developed, supported, and enhanced with each new release of ASP.NET Core.

### 13. **Component Libraries**
   - **Web Forms**: Has a rich library of server controls (e.g., GridView, Repeater, ListView) but limited flexibility for modern UI development.
   - **MVC**: Does not have server controls but encourages using Razor views and client-side libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, or modern JavaScript frameworks.

### Summary:

- **ASP.NET Web Forms** is older, uses a stateful and event-driven model, and is less suited for modern web development practices. Itâ€™s ideal for developers who prefer a drag-and-drop, control-based development model but may lack flexibility for building highly performant, modern applications.
  
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** is modern, lightweight, stateless, and fits well with today's web development trends. It offers more control, flexibility, and testability, making it a better choice for modern web applications. Web Forms does not exist in **ASP.NET Core**, and the MVC framework is the recommended approach for ASP.NET Core developers.
