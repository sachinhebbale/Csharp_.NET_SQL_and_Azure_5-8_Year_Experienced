Razor Pages is a feature of ASP.NET Core that makes it easier to build dynamic, data-driven web pages. It provides a page-focused framework that is designed to be a simpler and more streamlined alternative to the traditional MVC pattern in ASP.NET Core.

### Key Concepts of Razor Pages in .NET Core

1. **Page Model (Code-behind)**
   - Each Razor Page has an associated "PageModel" class which acts like the controller in MVC. It handles the logic for the page, such as event handling and data processing.
   - This class typically inherits from `PageModel` and is responsible for managing the state of the page and interacting with any services, databases, or other business logic.

2. **Routing**
   - Razor Pages use a simple, convention-based routing system, where the physical file structure of the pages in the project determines the URL structure.

3. **Two-way data binding**
   - You can bind properties in the PageModel to elements in the Razor page, which allows for two-way data binding. This is particularly useful for form submissions, as the data in form elements can be bound directly to properties in the PageModel.

4. **Handlers**
   - Instead of using traditional HTTP verbs like `GET` and `POST`, Razor Pages use handler methods. These methods start with `OnGet`, `OnPost`, etc., and map to specific actions depending on how the page is requested.
     ```csharp
     public class IndexModel : PageModel
     {
         public void OnGet()
         {
             // Logic for GET request
         }
         
         public void OnPost()
         {
             // Logic for POST request
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Razor Syntax**
   - Razor Pages use Razor syntax for embedding C# code in HTML. The syntax uses `@` for C# expressions.
     ```html
     <h1>Hello, @Model.Name!</h1>
     ```

6. **Dependency Injection**
   - Like other ASP.NET Core features, Razor Pages fully supports dependency injection, which allows services to be injected into the PageModel for use within the page.
     ```csharp
     public class IndexModel : PageModel
     {
         private readonly ILogger<IndexModel> _logger;

         public IndexModel(ILogger<IndexModel> logger)
         {
             _logger = logger;
         }

         public void OnGet()
         {
             _logger.LogInformation("Page loaded");
         }
     }
     ```

### Folder Structure
The Razor Pages convention requires you to put the `.cshtml` pages inside a folder named `Pages`. Each `.cshtml` file can have an accompanying `.cshtml.cs` file for the PageModel.

Example:
```
Pages/
   Index.cshtml
   Index.cshtml.cs
   About.cshtml
   About.cshtml.cs
```

### Advantages of Razor Pages
- **Simplicity**: Razor Pages are simpler to use than MVC when building basic web pages.
- **Page-centric**: Each page has a dedicated model, making it easier to handle the UI logic for that specific page.
- **Lightweight**: It requires less ceremony and boilerplate than the traditional MVC pattern, especially for simple applications.

### Example Razor Page

**Index.cshtml**
```html
@page
@model IndexModel

<h1>Welcome, @Model.Name!</h1>

<form method="post">
    <label for="name">Enter your name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="Name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

**Index.cshtml.cs**
```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    [BindProperty]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public void OnGet()
    {
        // Initial GET request
    }

    public void OnPost()
    {
        // Handle POST request when form is submitted
        // The Name property will automatically be bound to the form input
    }
}
```

Razor Pages is great for applications that need a simpler, page-centric model compared to the traditional MVC approach. It reduces complexity and speeds up development, especially for smaller applications or pages that donâ€™t need extensive customization.
