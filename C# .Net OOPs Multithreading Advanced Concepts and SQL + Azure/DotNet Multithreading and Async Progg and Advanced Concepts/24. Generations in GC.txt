### **Garbage Collection (GC) Generations in C# .NET**  
In C#, **Garbage Collection (GC)** is responsible for **automatic memory management**. To improve efficiency, the **.NET Garbage Collector (GC)** divides objects into **three generations**:

| **Generation** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Gen 0 (Youngest)** | Short-lived objects (temporary variables, method-scoped objects) |
| **Gen 1** | Medium-lived objects (objects surviving one GC cycle) |
| **Gen 2 (Oldest)** | Long-lived objects (static objects, global variables, large objects) |

---

## **1. How Generations Work?**
- **Gen 0**: Objects are allocated here first. **Frequent GC occurs** in this generation.
- **Gen 1**: If an object survives a **Gen 0 GC cycle**, it is promoted to Gen 1.
- **Gen 2**: If an object survives a **Gen 1 GC cycle**, it is moved to Gen 2.
- **Large Object Heap (LOH)**: Objects **> 85 KB** are directly allocated in Gen 2.

### **Garbage Collection Triggers**
- **Gen 0 GC runs most frequently.**  
- **Gen 1 is cleaned less often than Gen 0.**  
- **Gen 2 GC runs the least frequently (full GC).**

## **2. Example: Checking Object Generation**
C# provides the `GC.GetGeneration(object)` method to check an object's generation.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        object obj = new object();  // Allocated in Gen 0
        Console.WriteLine("Gen: " + GC.GetGeneration(obj));  // Expected: 0

        GC.Collect();  // Forcing GC
        Console.WriteLine("Gen after GC: " + GC.GetGeneration(obj));  // Might be 1 if survived

        GC.Collect();  // Forcing GC again
        Console.WriteLine("Final Gen: " + GC.GetGeneration(obj));  // Might be 2 if survived
    }
}
```

---

## **3. Large Object Heap (LOH) & GC Behavior**
- Objects **larger than 85 KB** are **directly allocated in Gen 2**.
- LOH is **only cleaned during a full GC (Gen 2 GC)**.

```csharp
byte[] largeArray = new byte[100000]; // Directly in Gen 2
Console.WriteLine(GC.GetGeneration(largeArray)); // Output: 2
```

---

## **4. Forcing Garbage Collection**
Although **GC runs automatically**, we can trigger it manually:

```csharp
GC.Collect(0); // Collects only Gen 0
GC.Collect(1); // Collects Gen 0 and Gen 1
GC.Collect(2); // Full GC (Gen 0, Gen 1, Gen 2)
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers(); // Ensures Finalize methods execute
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Avoid using `GC.Collect()` unless necessary, as it can impact performance.

---

## **5. Generational GC Optimization**
- **Short-lived objects** (e.g., local variables) remain in Gen 0 and are cleaned frequently.
- **Long-lived objects** (e.g., static objects) are promoted to Gen 2, reducing GC overhead.
- **Pinned objects** (like `GCHandle`) may prevent memory from being freed.

---

## **6. Summary**
| **Concept** | **Details** |
|------------|------------|
| **Gen 0** | Short-lived, frequent GC |
| **Gen 1** | Mid-life objects, less frequent GC |
| **Gen 2** | Long-lived, least frequent GC |
| **Large Object Heap (LOH)** | Directly allocated in Gen 2, rarely collected |
| **`GC.Collect()`** | Can force GC but should be used sparingly |
