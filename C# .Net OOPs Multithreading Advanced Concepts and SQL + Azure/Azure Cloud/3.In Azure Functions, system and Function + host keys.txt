In **Azure Functions**, system and host keys are used to secure and control access to the function app's endpoints. These keys are primarily used for managing API-level security and restricting access.

### Types of Keys in Azure Functions

1. **Function Keys**: These are used to secure individual functions.
2. **Host Keys**: These apply to all functions within a function app.
3. **System Keys**: These are used for internal purposes and integrations, and they are managed by Azure.

#### **Host Keys**

- **Scope**: Host keys are scoped to the entire function app. They can be used to authenticate requests to any function within the function app.
- **Usage**: 
   - Host keys allow you to access all the functions under a function app without needing to use individual function keys.
   - These keys are often used when setting up external integrations or managing function apps via the Azure API.
   - You can define multiple host keys and also have a default host key that can be rotated.
   - Typically, host keys are stored in the function app’s `host.json` file.

- **Types of Host Keys**:
  - **`default` Host Key**: Automatically generated when the function app is created. It can be used for broad access.
  - **Custom Host Keys**: You can create custom host keys for different users or integrations, and they allow better management of access.

#### **System Keys**

- **Scope**: System keys are used internally by Azure and are typically not meant for direct use by developers.
- **Usage**:
  - System keys are automatically generated and are used for internal Azure services or extensions like Durable Functions, Event Grid, or Azure API Management.
  - These keys ensure that Azure services can securely call functions or trigger them.
  - They are not meant for external users and usually cannot be modified or managed through the function app settings.

- **Internal Azure Use**: These keys are utilized when Azure’s internal services like Event Grid or other integrations need to trigger or access a function securely without requiring a user-provided key.

### **Managing Keys**

- You can manage both host and function keys through the **Azure Portal**, **Azure CLI**, or **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
- To access keys via the Azure Portal:
  - Navigate to the function app -> **Functions** -> Select the function -> **Function Keys** for managing function-specific keys.
  - **Host Keys** can be accessed from the "Function App" section -> **Host Keys**.

### Key Differences

- **Host Keys**: Provide broad access to all functions within a function app. Typically used in scenarios where multiple functions need to be accessed by the same client.
- **System Keys**: Used for internal Azure integrations and are not intended for user management or external access. These are more specialized and automatically managed by Azure.
