ASP.NET Core provides built-in session management to store and retrieve user-specific data across requests. Sessions are useful for tracking data between requests for individual users, such as shopping cart contents or user authentication information. Here’s an overview of how ASP.NET Core handles session management:

### Key Concepts of Session in ASP.NET Core:

1. **Session Storage**: ASP.NET Core session stores data as key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is an object, which is serialized.
   
2. **Session Lifetime**: A session is typically tied to a specific user and is maintained across multiple requests, but it expires after a certain time or if the browser is closed (if configured with cookie-based session IDs).

3. **Session Configuration**:
   To use session management in ASP.NET Core, you need to configure the session in `Startup.cs`.

#### Steps to Configure and Use Sessions:

### 1. Add Session Middleware
In the `ConfigureServices` method, add the session service:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();  // Required for session storage.
    services.AddSession(options =>
    {
        options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20); // Set session timeout.
        options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;                // Protect from client-side scripts.
        options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;             // Ensure session cookie is always created.
    });
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}
```

### 2. Add Session Middleware in HTTP Pipeline
In the `Configure` method, add the session middleware to the HTTP request pipeline:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    // Other middleware like UseRouting, UseStaticFiles, etc.
    
    app.UseSession(); // Make sure to add this before UseEndpoints.
    
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

### 3. Storing Data in Session
You can store simple values like integers or strings in the session like this:
```csharp
HttpContext.Session.SetString("UserName", "JohnDoe");
HttpContext.Session.SetInt32("UserId", 123);
```

### 4. Retrieving Data from Session
To retrieve the data from the session, use:
```csharp
var userName = HttpContext.Session.GetString("UserName");
var userId = HttpContext.Session.GetInt32("UserId");
```

### 5. Remove Data from Session
You can remove a specific session key-value pair:
```csharp
HttpContext.Session.Remove("UserName");
```
Or, clear all session data:
```csharp
HttpContext.Session.Clear();
```

### 6. Session Backing Stores
By default, sessions are stored in memory using **Distributed Memory Cache**, but ASP.NET Core also supports other session storage mechanisms like:
- **Distributed SQL Server Cache**
- **Distributed Redis Cache**
- **Distributed NCache**

To use these, you'd configure the session differently based on the type of storage.

### Notes:
- **Cookies**: ASP.NET Core uses a cookie to track the session ID. If cookies are disabled in the browser, sessions won’t work.
- **Serialization**: Complex objects must be serialized to store in the session. ASP.NET Core provides `ISession` interface for reading/writing serialized data.
