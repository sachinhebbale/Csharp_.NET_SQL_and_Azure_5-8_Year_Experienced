The `response_type` parameter in an OAuth 2.0 authorization request specifies what kind of authorization response the client is expecting from the authorization server. Different values of `response_type` are associated with different OAuth 2.0 grant types or flows.

Here are the most common values for the `response_type` parameter:

### 1. `response_type=code`
- **Used in**: Authorization Code Flow.
- **Purpose**: Indicates that the client is requesting an **authorization code**, which it will later exchange for an access token via the token endpoint.
- **Flow**: 
  - The client redirects the user to the **authorize endpoint** with `response_type=code`.
  - The authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code.
  - The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token at the **token endpoint**.
  
  **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  https://authorization-server.com/auth?
      response_type=code&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&
      redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
      scope=SCOPE&
      state=STATE
  ```

### 2. `response_type=token`
- **Used in**: Implicit Flow.
- **Purpose**: Indicates that the client is requesting an **access token** directly in the authorization response, without the need for a separate token request.
- **Flow**: 
  - The client sends the user to the **authorize endpoint** with `response_type=token`.
  - The authorization server redirects the user back to the client with the access token embedded in the URL fragment (`#`).
  
  **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  https://authorization-server.com/auth?
      response_type=token&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&
      redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
      scope=SCOPE&
      state=STATE
  ```

### 3. `response_type=code token` (or `code id_token`)
- **Used in**: Hybrid Flow (OpenID Connect).
- **Purpose**: Used when the client wants to receive both an **authorization code** and an **access token** or an **ID token** in the authorization response.
- **Flow**:
  - The authorization server returns both an authorization code and a token (or an ID token).
  
  **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  https://authorization-server.com/auth?
      response_type=code%20token&
      client_id=CLIENT_ID&
      redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
      scope=SCOPE&
      state=STATE
  ```

### Summary of Grant Types and Their `response_type`:
- **Authorization Code Flow**: `response_type=code`
- **Implicit Flow**: `response_type=token` (or `id_token` for OpenID Connect)
- **Hybrid Flow (OIDC)**: `response_type=code token`, `response_type=code id_token`

The `response_type` tells the authorization server what kind of response to send back, whether it be an authorization code, an access token, or an ID token.
