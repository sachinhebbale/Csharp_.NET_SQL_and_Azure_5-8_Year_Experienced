In .NET Core, the term **"lightweight"** generally refers to the framework's **small footprint, modular architecture, and optimized performance**. Hereâ€™s what makes .NET Core lightweight:  

### 1. **Minimal Deployment Size**
   - Unlike the full .NET Framework, .NET Core allows **self-contained applications** where only the necessary components are included.  
   - This reduces the overall deployment size and makes applications easier to distribute.  

### 2. **Modular & NuGet-based**
   - .NET Core follows a **modular** approach where you include only the necessary libraries instead of a monolithic framework.  
   - You can install and update components individually via **NuGet**, making applications more efficient.  

### 3. **Cross-Platform Efficiency**
   - Since .NET Core is designed to work on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**, it is optimized for performance across different environments.  
   - This means fewer dependencies and better resource utilization.  

### 4. **Optimized Performance**
   - The **Kestrel web server** (used in ASP.NET Core) is highly optimized for performance, handling requests efficiently with minimal overhead.  
   - .NET Core has a **garbage collector** designed for high throughput and low memory consumption.  

### 5. **Container-Friendly**
   - .NET Core works well in **Docker** and other containerized environments due to its small size and minimal dependencies.  

In short, **"lightweight" in .NET Core means smaller, faster, and more efficient compared to the traditional .NET Framework**. ðŸš€
